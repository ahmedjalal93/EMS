# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

I tried to keep my code simple
I tried to keep everything organized as far as what this application can do
I made 4 categories to choose from add, view, update and delete
I made sub-categories related to each of a single category to keep everything organized for the user end
I used promises to and async function to keep my data accessible 
I made a pre-defined query selections for managers, employees, roles and departments to use them through out the questions
I passed the id as part of the returned query results and displayed them to the user which will allow me to use them directly after the user selection
I'm calling the function everytime the user get the results to restart the app from the beginning
